SynSeq is a standalone LabVIEW based sequencer-synthesizer with built-in ADSR Envelope Generator, 16-step sequencer regulated with knobs that allow user to use microtonal music sequeces and TBD

The design was heavily inspired by KORG SR-1, KORG Volca's, Roland drum machines and the modular diy eurorack-compatible synthesizer scene.
 

The program uses 2 {UPDATE WHEN NECESSERY} custom SubVI's:
	- ADSR_Envelope_Generation_subVI;
	- FrequencyArrayToHz_SubVI;

Front panel is equipped with several Waveform graphs:
	- graph of ADSR Envelope;
	- current waveform;
	- Fast Fourier Transform graph of the currently played note.

Controls for the sequencer are as listed:
	- 16 knobs for all of the steps of the sequencer,
	- volume knob,
	- BPM knob,
	- 4 sliders that control ADSR envelope generation;
